1)Domain:  Hospitality       Function: Revenue

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

Task:  

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

Create the metrics according to the metric list.
Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

2)Domain:  Telecom    Function: Executive Management

AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.

However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. AtliQo’s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. They also wonder if they can optimize their internet plans to get more active users.  Peter Pandey, a junior data analyst, is assigned to this task.

Task:  

Imagine yourself as Peter Pandey and perform the following task:

Create the comparison report based on the mock-up provided. Please note the mock-up is created by a business user who has minimal idea about dashboarding. Hence, you need to represent the insights in a much better way.
The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence the dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.
Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard to support the cause.

3)SQL Project 
Domain:  Consumer Goods | Function: Executive Management

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.

Task:  

Imagine yourself as the applicant for this role and perform the following task

1.    Check ‘ad-hoc-requests.pdf’ - there are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.
2.    You need to run a SQL query to answer these requests. 
3.    The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence you need to create a presentation to show the insights.
